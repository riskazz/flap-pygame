# Flappy Bird Game

This is a simple Flappy Bird game project developed using Python PL and Pygame library. In this game, the player is prompted to control the bird's altitude to pass pipe obstacles. Credit goes to mehmettemineker who provided the template and assets that I used. Additional features and improvements are added.

## Gameplay
much like the previously classic Android games, Flappy Bird requires players to control the altitude of the bird, by pressing the space bar to go upwards or not pressing anything to lower the bird using the in-game gravity. Timing is key to preventing the bird from falling too quickly or going up too slowly. The game ends when the bird; collides with the pipe, crashes to the ground, or tries to leave the playing screen. Players try to pass as many obstacles and survive as long as they can.

run the python3 main.py files to play the game.

## Personal Objectives
This is my first game development project, which I am trying to 
1) enhance my Python programming skill
2) practice and explore a wide range of Python libraries (Pygame in this instance)

## Added features
- Starting signals before the game starts
- Game physics (such as the bird's incline and decline rotation)
- Increasing difficulty (as the score goes higher)
- Thumbnail icon added
