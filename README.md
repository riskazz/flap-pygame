# Flappy Bird Game

This is a simple Flappy Bird game project developed using Python PL and Pygame library. In this game, player are prompted to control the bird altitude to pass a pipe obstacles. Credits goes to mehmettemineker who provided template and assets i used are from. Additionals features and improvement are added.

## Gameplay
much like the previously classic android games, Flappy bird require players to control the altitude of the bird, by pressing space bar to go upwards or not pressing anything to lower the bird using the in-game gravity. Timing is key to prevent the bird from falling to quickly or going up to slowly. The game ends when the bird; collide with the pipe, crashing to the ground, or trying to leave the playing screen. Players try to pass as many obstacles and survive as long as they can.

run the python3 main.py files to play the game.

## Personal Objectives
This is my first game development projects, to which i try to 
1) enhance my python programming skill
2) practice and explore wide range of python library (Pygame in this instance)

## Added features
- Starting signals before game start
- Game physics (such as the bird's incline and decline rotation)
- Increasing difficulty (as the score goes higher)
- Thumbnail icon added
